#  Code Review

## Correctness

- Anagrams are successfully grouped together and returned as a list of lists by the code.
- Overall, the code is nicely designed and completes its intended task quickly and accurately.

## Efficiency

- The groupAnagrams function has a temporal complexity of O(n * k * log k), where n is the number of strings in the input list and k is the longest string possible.
- This is due to the fact that the function first sorts each string in the list, which requires O(k * log k), and then searches the dictionary for each string, which typically requires O(1) time.
Overall, the problem's temporal complexity is appropriate.

## Style 

-  The code uses 4 spaces for indentation, which is the recommended style in the Python community.
- The code uses whitespace effectively to make the code more readable. For example, 
there are spaces after commas and around operators like = and :.
- The code follows the Python naming conventions for classes (Solution) and functions (groupAnagrams). 
- The variable names are also descriptive and give a good indication of what they represent.
- The style of the code is generally decent. It is simple to read and comprehend and adheres to Python norms.
It might be much better with a few simple adjustments, such adding error handling and more thorough comments.

## Documentation

- It would be beneficial to provide some extra comments that provide a more thorough explanation of the method.
